# Core-Billing

This is my second release and I made a simple POS billing system that:  
- Allows employees to bill nearby players for goods or services.  
- Calculates employee profit automatically (10% of base price).  
- Bills can be accepted or declined by the customer.  
- Pending bills expire after 5 minutes if not accepted. Or if declined.
- Works with ox_lib notifications and input dialogs
- Validates prices server-side to prevent manipulation.  
- Stores pending bills in a simple table and removes them once paid or expired.  

I thought this was perfect for small shops, roleplay stores, or as a lightweight alternative to more complex billing systems.
